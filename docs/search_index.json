Fall 2024 Chapter 1 Introduction Hi everyone! I’m Ihnwhi. It is my great pleasure to be your guest lecturer for PSY202A. Statistical modeling is a key component in conducting research in the psychological sciences. While many statistical toolkits are available to researchers, R is arguably one of the most useful free and open-source statistical software programs. It offers a dizzying array of analytic options to answer your important and exciting research questions. In the upcoming four lab sessions, you will be introduced to R and become familiar with its capabilities. These sessions are designed to help you get acquainted with the fundamentals of R and learn how to use it wisely as the next generation of psychologists. You will then be guided through summarizing and analyzing data using R. Are you ready? Let’s get it on! "],["introduction-to-r-part-1.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction to R: Part 1 2.1 What is it?

Mplus is a statistical modeling program that provides researchers with a flexible tool to analyze data Many models: regression, path analysis, factor analysis, SEM, MLM, longitudinal models, mixture model, mediation/moderation Many data: cross-sectional, longitudinal, single-/multilevel, observed/latent, incomplete Many variables: continuous, dichotomous, categorical, count Many estimator: maximum likelihood, weighted least squares, Bayesian 2.2 Syntax-based programming Commands and subcommands (https://www.statmodel.com/language.html) Examples of commands?

Commands should end with colon (:), and subcommands should end with semicolon (;) Syntax is not case sensitive Data should consist of numeric values, with no variable names Data and Mplus input file should be in the same directory (like an R working directory) Otherwise, be sure to specify the correct directory 2.4 Some tips about model command particularly Start with a path diagram Think of it as specifying model parameters Care to the degrees of freedom (DF) 2.5 Example: Multiple linear regression using maximum likelihood estimation 2.5.1 Model syntax !
